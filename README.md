To include HTML code snippets in your README.md file, you can use triple backticks (
) before and after the code block. For example:

html








Hello, World!





Similarly, you can include CSS code snippets using triple backticks with the language specified after the first set of backticks. For example:

css
body {
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
color: #333;
}
